Q2 2023 Update
========================

## Collections 

Our average collections decreased by 23% from TZS 8.5 million in Q1 20223 to TZS 6.4 million in Q2 2023 leading to significant liquidity constraints and an inability to undertake meaningful improvements for our compound.   

As a result, we have only focused on ensuring our funds cover salaries and other relevant recurrent expenditures (amounting to TZS 8.5mill monthly); to the point of running arrears on our statutory obligations. 

We urgently require HOs to please pay any outstanding obligations; for those with large outstandings, we are very receptive to partial payments as we urgently need to build a liquidity buffer of at least 1 to 2 months.  

As of May and June, our accounts held TZS 1mill after recurrent payments! A terrible position for us to be in. 

## Security 

Increased salaries and new working tools were undertaken in Q1 and weekly gwaride training is ongoing. We are thankful for our two HOs who assisted with a new phone and comfortable seating at our main gate; this has contributed greatly to daily gate operations as well as comfort for our guards. 

We have not been able to undertake any other initiatives as planned due to a lack of funds; as such we have been unable to undertake initiatives such as the creation of a SACCOS/VICOBA tied to NHIF, as well as enhance security operations because both needed external consultations that require funding. 

## Garbage & Environment 

We procured all tools for our subcontractor as well as increased his monthly payment in Q1 2023. All is progressing well on this front, with the estate office undertaking inspections every two weeks with Mwita. 

From an environmental perspective, we have had to still delay any work on drainage and related repairs due to insufficient funds. We have revamped our palm/beach walk to a significant extent, and continue to keep our open space green. 

## SBR Clubhouse 

The current operator is progressing well with paying arrears that had accumulated (as well as current charges as they come due); she is scheduled to hand over at the end of the year. 

We have not been able to initiate a “pay as you go” WiFi system at the clubhouse due to a lack of funds.  

## Billing & Accounting System 

As previously communicated we have installed a cloud-based accounting ERP to automate our operations. A few HOs have received incorrect bills as part of our “teething” process. For the most part, we have updated all individual accounts for HOs as well as continue to send out acknowledgments for payments received.  

We are halfway through migrating our accounts onto the cloud-based ER+P, and are looking at putting into place a LIPA NAMBA by the end of Q3 2023. 

Ulinzi Shirikishi & HOs with large Service Charge Arrears 

We also communicated our intention to use the existing Ulinzi Shirikishi legal framework in Tanzania as a mechanism to ensure collection and enforce legal penalties for the security portion of our service charge. We have been unable to initiate this process as it requires legal oversight and hence funds. 

Thanks and regards,
