# Publish Markdown Files

- This open-source project would be perfect for your needs : [compiiile](https://github.com/AlbanCrepel/compiiile). It allows you to render all Markdown files from a folder and make a live website out of it with included navigation and search.
- Markdown is about writing simple syntax and automatically get an Html file. How you publish an html file to the world is up to you. Me? I like to create a github gist with a markdown file and share a link; github renders it nicely without having to generate an html myself.
- The most straightforward way of doing it is using something like [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/) or some vscode code extension to convert your markdown to html, then you can upload those to [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/) or other hosting service, if you have your files on a github repository, you can use it to to host them as a web :)
- For your sharing, do you absolutely need the Internet (in that you want to give them a link)? You could export the markdown file as a PDF, upload the PDF, then configure share permissions with the other individual. You could look into GitHub pages too and see if that's suitable for your needs.
- If you are familiar with GitHub and don't mind if it is public, use GitHub pages. [Github Pages](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/)
- The very easy way is to publish it in github.com (as a repo) and there, if needed, enable github pages for that repo. A beautiful approach will be to use docusaurus.io to create a static site on your host (but more difficult).
- You might also find my open source project Docsify-This of interest, it turns online Markdown files into Web pages/sites [docsify this](https://docsify-this.net/) You could also install your own instance of Docsify-This on GitHub (i.e. [https://hibbitts-design.github.io/hedgedoc-docsify-this](https://hibbitts-design.github.io/hedgedoc-docsify-this)) with a custom domain or copy the files over to an existing Web server (i.e. [https://docsify-this.hibbittsdesign.org](https://docsify-this.hibbittsdesign.org/)) More details at [https://docsify-this.net/#/?id=looking-for-even-more-customization-and-control](https://docsify-this.net/#/?id=looking-for-even-more-customization-and-control)
- Convert to html and throw into a public cloud folder synced to your computer. You're basically just saving your html file to a folder on your computer and it's accessible anywhere on the web. Or any of the previous suggestions will work well too. EDIT: For example, services like pcloud have public folders that sync from your computer. Not a huge fan of pcloud, but some of what they do works well. If you have a domain on some hosted server, just ssh into your folder with your md files and edit directly. That's slower and slightly less convenient, but allows for way more flexibility. EDIT2: Sorry, should go without saying that for domain option, you'd also convert to html for your friend. Easy breezy.
